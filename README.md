# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-for-Image-Reconstruction
This repository contains a segment of my master's project work, focusing on the aim of reconstructing the image of a red blood cell sample from its diffracted pattern using deep learning techniques. The project incorporates enhancements in image reconstruction through a hybrid approach, utilizing features such as the Space Channel Attention mechanism integrated into the network. I am delighted to share that my work has been selected for a poster presentation at the Digital Health Symposium and Roundtable 2023, hosted at IIT Kharagpur.
